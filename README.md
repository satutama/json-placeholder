# JsonPlaceholder

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.10.

This application uses [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API to fetch [100 posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).

All posts are rendered in a separate component and showed as squares, 10 rows x 10 columns.

By default, the post title is shown.
When clicking on a square, the title will be replaced with the userId.
When clicking again, the Id will be shown and so on...

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
